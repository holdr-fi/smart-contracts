/**
 * @title Managed Pool
 * @dev Weighted Pool with mutable tokens and weights, designed to be used in conjunction with a contract
 * (as the owner, containing any specific business logic). Since the pool itself permits "dangerous"
 * operations, it should never be deployed with an EOA as the owner.
 *
 * The owner contract can impose arbitrary access control schemes on its permissions: it might allow a multisig
 * to add or remove tokens, and let an EOA set the swap fees.
 *
 * Pool owners can also serve as intermediate contracts to hold tokens, deploy timelocks, consult with
 * other protocols or on-chain oracles, or bundle several operations into one transaction that re-entrancy
 * protection would prevent initiating from the pool contract.
 *
 * Managed Pools are designed to support many asset management use cases, including: large token counts,
 * rebalancing through token changes, gradual weight or fee updates, fine-grained control of protocol and
 * management fees, allowlisting of LPs, and more.
