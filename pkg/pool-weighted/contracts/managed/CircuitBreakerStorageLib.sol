/**
 * @title Circuit Breaker Storage Library
 * @notice Library for storing and manipulating state related to circuit breakers.
 * @dev The intent of circuit breakers is to halt trading of a given token if its value changes drastically -
 * in either direction - with respect to other tokens in the pool. For instance, a stablecoin might de-peg
 * and go to zero. With no safeguards, arbitrageurs could drain the pool by selling large amounts of the
 * token to the pool at inflated internal prices.
 *
 * The circuit breaker mechanism establishes a "safe trading range" for each token, expressed in terms of
 * the BPT price. Both lower and upper bounds can be set, and if a trade would result in moving the BPT price
 * of any token involved in the operation outside that range, the breaker is "tripped", and the operation
 * should revert. Each token is independent, since some might have very "tight" valid trading ranges, such as
 * stablecoins, and others are more volatile.
 *
 * The BPT price of a token is defined as the amount of BPT that could be redeemed for a single token.
 * For instance, in an 80/20 pool with a total supply of 1000, the 80% token accounts for 800 BPT. So each
 * token would be worth 800 / token balance. The formula is then: total supply * token weight / token balance.
 * (Note that this only applies *if* the pool is balanced (a condition that cannot be checked by the pool without
 * accessing price oracles.)
 *
 * We need to use the BPT price as the measure to ensure we account for the change relative to the rest of
 * the pool, which could have many other tokens. The drop detected by circuit breakers is analogous to
 * impermanent loss: it is relative to the performance of the other tokens. If the entire market tanks and
 * all token balances go down together, the *relative* change would be zero, and the breaker would not be
 * triggered: even though the external price might have dropped 50 or 70%. It is only the *relative* movement
 * compared to the rest of the pool that matters.
 *
 * If we have tokens A, B, and C, If A drops 20% and B and C are unchanged, that's a simple 20% drop for A.
 * However, if A is unchanged and C increases 25%, that would also be a 20% "drop" for A 1 / 1.25 = 0.8.
 * The breaker might register a 20% drop even if both go up - if our target token lags the market. For
 * instance, if A goes up 60% and B and C double, 1.6 / 2 = 0.8.
 *
 * Since BPT prices are not intuitive - and there is a very non-linear relationship between "spot" prices and
 * BPT prices - circuit breakers are set using simple percentages. Intuitively, a lower bound of 0.8 means the
 * token can lose 20% of its value before triggering the circuit breaker, and an upper bound of 3.0 means it
 * can triple before being halted. These percentages are then transformed into BPT prices for comparison to the
 * "reference" state of the pool when the circuit breaker was set.
 *
 * Prices can change in two ways: arbitrage traders responding to external price movement can change the balances,
 * or an ongoing gradual weight update (or change in pool composition) can change the weights. In order to isolate
 * the balance changes due to price movement, the bounds are dynamic, adjusted for the current weight.

     * @notice Returns the dynamic lower and upper BPT price bounds for a given token, at the current weight.
     * @dev The current BPT price of the token can be directly compared to these values, to determine whether
     * the circuit breaker has tripped. If a bound is 0, it means there is no circuit breaker in that direction
     * for this token: there might be a lower bound, but no upper bound. If the current BPT price is less than
     * the lower bound, or greater than the non-zero upper bound, the transaction should revert.
     *
     * These BPT price bounds are dynamically calculated using the conversion ratios. In general:
     * lower/upper BPT price bound = bptPrice * "conversion ratio". The conversion ratio is given as
     * (boundaryPercentage)**(weightComplement).
     *
     * For instance, given the 80/20 BAL/WETH pool with a 90% lower bound, the weight complement would be
     * (1 - 0.8) = 0.2, so the lower BPT price bound conversion ratio would be (0.9 ** 0.2) ~ 0.9791.
     * Intuitively, if you had a 50/50 pool with equal balances, the spot price and BPT price would move
     * together: a 20% drop in spot price would correspond to a 20% drop in BPT price.
     *
     * But with unequal weights (assuming a balance pool), the balance of a higher-weight token will respond less
     * to a proportional change in spot price than a lower weight token. In the simulations, Integrations
     * coined the term "balance inertia".
     *
     * If the external price drops, all else being equal, the pool would be arbed until the percent drop in spot
     * price equaled the external price drop. Since during this process the *internal* pool price would be
     * above market, the arbers would sell cheap tokens to our poor unwitting pool at inflated prices, raising
     * the balance of the depreciating token, and lowering the balance of another token (WETH in this example).
     *
     * Using weighted math, and assuming for simplicity that the sum of all weights is 1, you can compute the
     * amountIn ratio for the arb trade as: (1/priceRatio) ** (1 - weight). For our 0.9 ratio and a weight of
     * 0.8, this is ~ 1.0213. So if you had 8000 tokens before, the ending balance would be 8000*1.0213 ~ 8170.
     * Note that the higher the weight, the lower this ratio is. That means the counterparty token is going
     * out proportionally faster than the arb token is coming in: hence the non-linear relationship between
     * spot price and BPT price.
     *
     * If we call the initial balance B0, and set k = (1/priceRatio) ** (1 - weight), the post-arb balance is
     * given by: B1 = k * B0. Since the BPTPrice0 = totalSupply*weight/B0, and BPTPrice1 = totalSupply*weight/B1,
     * we can combine these equations to compute the BPT price ratio BPTPrice1/BPTPrice0 = 1/k; BPT1 = BPT0/k.
     * So we see that the "conversion factor" between the spot price ratio and BPT Price ratio can be written
     * as above BPT1 = BPT0 * (1/k), or more simply: (reference BPT price) * (priceRatio)**(1 - weight).
     *
     * If the value of the weight complement has not changed, we can use the reference conversion ratios stored
     * when the breaker was set. Otherwise, we need to calculate them.
     *
     * As described in the general comments above, the weight complement calculation attempts to isolate changes
     * in the balance due to arbitrageurs responding to external prices, from internal price changes caused by an
     * ongoing weight update, or changes to the pool composition. There is a non-linear relationship between "spot"
     * price changes and BPT price changes. This calculation transforms one into the other.

     * @param weightComplement - The complement of this token's weight, generally given by (1 - weight).
